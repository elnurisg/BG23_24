# About This Repository

Sorry for the messy code; it was developed under competition constraints and it was my first acquaintance with forecasting. 

This repository serves as a personal archive, while the code may not adhere to best practices and may be disorganized, it reflects my journey in exploring forecasting and malware detection tasks, including participation in competitions.

This repository is a work in progress, and I may revisit and improve the code in the future. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and this repository represents a snapshot of my efforts at different points in time.

If you are reviewing this repository, I encourage you to consider it within the context of my learning journey and willingness to engage in challenging projects. Your understanding is appreciated.
